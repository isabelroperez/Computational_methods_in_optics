### Exercise 3:
Create a program where the user is asked for their name, surname, and date of birth. Then, generate a proposal for an email address (name.surname@usal.es) and a password using the date of birth.

### Exercise 4:
Generate a file with numerical data of different types and formats, including text, etc. Write a program to read and display the contents of the file.

### Exercise 6:
Compare two mathematically identical floats generated in different ways (a=1.234567 and b=1.234566, b=b+0.000001). Compare them (a==b) and observe the result. What is the origin of this problem?

### Exercise 7:
Calculate if a future year will be a leap year using nested if statements.

### Exercise 8:
Define a Gaussian function, write the data points (x, f(x)) to a text file, and numerically calculate the total width of its square at a height of 1/e^2. Display the result on the screen.

### Exercise 9:
Print numbers from 1 to 20 without printing 13. Make the computer display the first 20 odd numbers.

### Exercise 10:
Create a program that determines the largest number among three given numbers. Implement this using a function "maximum" outside the main function.

### Exercise 12:
Create a program to demonstrate how a spatial filter works. Filter a signal measured in the laboratory to smooth it out. The program should be based on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) obtained from a library like FFTW (www.fftw.org). Write the filtered distribution to a file for comparison with the original.
